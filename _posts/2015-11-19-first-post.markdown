## Why a blog?

I decided start a blog. I am not new to writing things - just this time I want to have a place for it. For short, silly or ephemeric things - still, I am going to use *Facebook*. There is no point in polluting this space.

## Why Jekyll?

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static page generator. It's supported by GitHub, so there is no extra effort in starting, or maintaining it.

* I like Markdown.
* I like GitHub.
* I like simplicity. (And I don't need fancy features.)
* Yet, I want to configure some stuff.
* I use LaTeX and I want to be able to use any HTML code (SVG diagrams, D3.js visualizations...).
* I am concerned about achieving things in plain formats.
* I want to avoid distractions. 
* Commits gamify my efforts. (Seriously!)

My Wikidot site [migdal.wikidot.com](http://migdal.wikidot.com/) is probably staying (at least - for some time). But for further texts I prefer something cleaner, simpler.

## What's going there?

My interests. Right now I don't want to focus this blog on any subspace of my interests.

Moreover, I wrote a number of things over various places - sometimes on the initiatives I have participated in, sometimes as cockoo-style blogging (which I recommend a lot!). I intend to archive them here as well. For some write-ups it is going to be a good opportunity to translate them into English.

Also, there are some e-mails I have been resending over and over, which I want to turn into blog posts.

## How often do I want to post?

I make no claims.
