I teach deep learning both for living (as a [deepsense.io instructor](http://workshops.deepsense.io/)) and for fun/mission [Polish Children's Fund](http://crastina.se/gifted-children-in-poland-by-piotr-migdal/) (this Jan we had a NSFL project).

In this post I don't intent to teach neural networks, but to point to useful resources.

To start your you need basics of Python syntax and very simple mathematics.
I suggest starting with [Keras](https://keras.io/), a high-level neural network library in Python.

* [Neural Networks Demystified](http://lumiverse.io/series/neural-networks-demystified) - smooth introduction


## Examples

Before you start learning, let's play in your browser:

* [TensorFlow Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org/) for point separation
* [ConvNetJS](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/) for digit and image recognition
*

## Mathematics

Deep learning (that is - neural networks with many layers) use very simple

* vectors, matrices, multi-dimensional arrays
* addition, multiplication,
* [convolutions](http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/) to extract and process local patterns,
* activation functions: [sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function), [tanh](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=tanh[x]), [ReLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_%28neural_networks%29) to add non-linearity,
* [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) to convert vectors into probabilities,
* [log-loss (cross-entropy)](http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/9302/the-cross-entropy-error-function-in-neural-networks) to penalize wrong guesses in a smart way.

If your background is in physics, mathematics, statistics or signal processing - most likely you already know more than enough.

If you last contact with mathematics was in high-school, don't worry. This mathematics is simple to a point that a convolutional neural network for digit recognition can be implemented in a spreadsheet (with no macros):

* [Deep Spreadsheets with ExcelNet](http://www.deepexcel.net/)


## Frameworks

The most popular deep learning frameworks use, or at least - support, Python.
Some of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/), [Torch](http://torch.ch/).

Unlike

If you like philosophy of Python (brevity, readability, one preferred way to do things), Keras is for you.

## Dataset

I recommend starting with [MNIST digit recognition dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) (60k grayscale 28x28 images).

A more interesting dataset, and harder for classical machine learning algorithms, is [notMNIST](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html) (letters A-J from strange fonts). If you want to start with in, here is my [gist for notMNIST loading and logistic regression in Keras](https://gist.github.com/stared/70daf8e0334abf6e7527259e7221f568).

## Infrastructure

For small problems, you can use your personal computer - even if it is a laptop and computations are on CPU.

For medium problems, you might be still able to use PC, but
