# Dating for nerds

> Go beyond carbon dating!


## tl;dr

(to write)
* just talk to her
* invite for a coffee
* let her talk
* smoothly increase the number of physical contact
* in case of doubt: ask
* read How to Win Friends and Influence People

And the worst thing that can happen:

* the only conversation option will be to take a quest to kill a dragon; you really don't want to harm this endangered species
* caffeine overdosing; ending with a heart attack after seeing a bill from an overpriced coffee chain
* she will accidentally mention being in a secret werewolf conspiracy ("let's be fiends")

This blog post bases on a premise:

> She is a person.

And perhaps a more shocking one:

> You are a person too.


## Intro

I am not sure if I want to publish pieces of dating advice on my semi-professional blog. It is a more soft, opinionated and personal matter, inadvertently revealing my secrets and vulnerabilities. Though, if it is true that *"data science is the sexiest job of the 21st century"*, maybe technical issues and dating are not that far apart.

Also, to be clear: I don't claim to be "good at dating", whatever that means. But I see the profound change from something being frustrating to a field where I feel well.
And I would like to share some lessons I've learned in the process, often the hard way.

While my frustration with dating (or rather: not dating) gave me a lot of pain, it also prompted me to put a lot of effort in developing social skills in general.

There is no shortage of Internet dating advice. Yet, there weren't many thing I found illuminating. Nerds have special needs, special skills and things which may work differently (honesty, emotions, spontaneousity) - a general advice may not cut it.


## Audience

My target audience is myself at 15-25 (the sooner the better). It would have saved me so much emotional pain, feeling of loneliness, rejection and isolation[^osamotnienie].
Still, I will try to write from a more general perspective, so that it may be actually useful for a wider audience than my younger self (who would probably never read this)[^alchemist].

This text is addressed to heterosexual nerds ([not necessary white, though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9qYF9DZPdw)).
Some things may work for male-nonnerds or female-nerds[^nerdowka] (I have little idea how it works for LBTG+). Nerds come in all sizes and shapes, so what was important for me may be irrelevant (or harmful) for you.
(As always, before taking this advice consult you doctor, rabbi, PhD advisor, reptilian overlord.)

At least, I spiked it with numerous references, so even if you fine with dating, you may find a few interesting links.

A large portion of information is on approaching people in general, or advancing any relationship (surprisingly many things I learnt from dating are crucial for my business networking skills).

While I use word *nerd* a lot, it's not about self-identification.


If you are the recipient side of nerd's (however clumsy) courtship, I hope that you will learn a bit about his POV and be able to help him (whether it means taking command or turning him down in a clear but graceful way).


## It is not about

* Picking up as many girls as possible.
* Appealing to any girl.
* A motivational talk (I won't invent anything better than this [mongoose fending off lions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TPn1-SJqVM); still, scaring off every interested female is not the thing you want to do).
* A magical trick (like [s/wand/wang](http://www.bash.org/?111338)).
* A zero-sum game.


## Context

### The nerd condition

I am a (very) local guru in the geek vs nerd division.
I advise consulting:

* [Geeks vs Nerds - Geek Studies](http://web.archive.org/web/20110829164446/http://www.geekstudies.org/2007/06/geeks-vs-nerds) by Jason Tocci (his [PhD thesis on this topic](http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/953/)) and links therein
* [On “Geek” Versus “Nerd”](https://slackprop.wordpress.com/2013/06/03/on-geek-versus-nerd/) by Burr Settles

If you are highly intellectual, socially awkward person, you qualify.
Also, if you are actually reading this blog post, you qualify.
(Well, and it is a longish article, full of references, on a topic you wouldn't like to share in the office.)
Nerds may get it harder with interpersonal skills and their social position, see:

* [Why Nerds are Unpopular](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html) by Paul Graham (2003)
* [Autistic traits, science and the nerd sterotype](http://crastina.se/autistic-traits-science-and-the-nerd-stereotype/) by me

Dating is a social activity - so there should be no surprise that problems with social activity may make it hard to date. But they are not the only thing complicating the stuff:

* [Why Being Smart Won't Get You Laid](http://www.alternet.org/story/129887/why_being_smart_won't_get_you_laid) by Alex Benzer (2008)

In short - being very picky and having other main focus than mating makes dating hard.
It seems that data support it:

* [Intercourse and Intelligence](http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/04/intercourse-and-intelligence.php) by Jason Malloy (2007)

It mentions some really scary statistics like (though, it is at best `2*` data, according to the [Sex by Numbers](https://www.amazon.com/Sex-Numbers-Statistics-Behaviour-Wellcome-ebook/dp/B00NG3OJUK/) credibility scale):

> By the age of 19, 80% of US males and 75% of women have lost their virginity, and 87% of college students have had sex. But this number appears to be much lower at elite (i.e. more intelligent) colleges. According to [the article](http://web.archive.org/web/20060905085008/http://counterpoint.mit.edu/archives/Counterpoint_V21_I3_2001_Nov.pdf), only 56% of Princeton undergraduates have had intercourse. At Harvard 59% of the undergraduates are non-virgins, and at MIT, only a slight majority, 51%, have had intercourse. Further, only 65% of MIT graduate students have had sex.

From my anecdata, the main pain points are:

* **poor social skills** - most of dating is in the extra-intellectual sphere, about reading cues, knowing cultural expectations and attracting (not: persuading) people
* **poor body language** - sex is fundamentally about body - being a brain on a stick won't let you far
* **unfavourable gender ratios** - many nerdy places (like math/phys/cs departments) don't have many girls; regardless of the reason, if you stick only to them, it can by an uphill battle
* **overthinking** - there are no perfect people; and initial impressions of a person may be not enough for predicting future possibilities
* **talking not doing** - one common trap is that once you find a fascinating girl, you keep talking but don't do anything in sexual direction
* **being misread** - a lot of your actions may be consider rude, malicious or cold; for example, [prosopagnosia](http://web.archive.org/web/20080704154655/http://www.prosopagnosia.com/main/stones/index.asp) may be read as ignoring people, saying raw thoughts can be seen as an insult, etc
* **having niche interests** - mainstream interests can attract a wider spectrum of people; while some of it is a challenge you will face, you don't want to make your absorption spectrum a Dirac delta (particle physics offer many dating analogies: *Even if you cannot increase you absorption cross section, you can increase your flux.*)
* **facts over emotions** - correcting someone's errors in casual conversation and delivering truth in their raw form is a thing nerds excel at; for a nerd a constructive criticism is the highest praise, for everyone else it is an insult.

I will go how to address these points.

A large portion of culture is directed the non-nerds (let me invent a word: *neurotypicalonormative*): extroverted, with automatic ability to pick social cues and non-verbal messages, not-doubting.

### Nerd superpowers

Don't cry, being a nerd is not only a challenge. Besides [insight into arcane things other people are not aware of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdUq2opPY-Q), and [reasonably good job prospects](http://p.migdal.pl/2016/03/15/data-science-intro-for-math-phys-background.html), some girls are interested in the brainy type.

What's crucial: you don't need to appeal to all women (*different strokes for different folks*). Some of them may be fellow nerds, some - not, but still, considering intellect, introversion and deep interests sexy.

One friend of mine wanted to write *Why do neurotypical girls fancy nerdy boys?*, on her romantic interests. When I asked her why, she said:

> I find genuine, intense interests and a lot of curiosity very attractive.

(I love nerds - Magda Kuś photo)

While being different may gave your bulling in primary school, now it may be an advantage - you stand out!

Also, particular interests may make it easier to find a very non-random girl - by meeting her through a network of like-minded friends, or an a specialistic event.


### Randomness of human interactions

There are no methods which work always or for everyone, every time.

It's not a mathematical problem, where (even if insanely difficult) there is a perfect solution. It's not a computer program, which works each time the same way. It's not a RPG game, where someone could give you a hint, in the light of:

> Talk with her: 1 3 3 2 4, then bring her a screwdriver, talk 3 1 1 2 and you are in her bed!

Maybe she flirts with you just because its her way of interacting with all people.
Maybe she doesn't talk much because she had a stressful day.
Maybe you did something clever, but it intimidated her.
Maybe you do something stupid, but she finds it funny.

While it helps a lot to pay attention to sign that she may be interested, agonizing over it is likely to result in overfitting - focusing on random things that are mere coincidences.

In social relations there are not sure solutions. It's all about increasing odds.
Think about a salesman, who want to sell a product - some people want to buy it no matter what, some won't, but many people are undecided, and it will all depend on the salesman's approach (also: if they go back to him to buy more, or feel scammed).

The same thing about dating - in some cases the girl is not interested and no amount of dating skills would change that. In some - she is interested and proactive, and you don't need much skills at all. But the uncertain zone is a big place - and here your skills matter a lot.

Also, you don't interact with an average girl. Even if there are things that on the average differ by gender (and can be nice initial guesses!), you will always interact with a particular girl.


### Psychology 101

Homo sapiens sapiens are a fascinating species, with complex social structures.
Their courtship rituals are rich and culture-dependent.
It is fascinating to read about their psychology... and as an earthbound alien, who go stranded here, you better learn it well!

(As a side note: Why do we need formal classes for mathematics, but it is assumed that we magically pick social skills on our own? I would rather do it the opposite way.)

For general psychology, I read and benefited from

* [R. Gerrig, P. Zimbardo, Psychology and Life](https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Life-16th-Richard-Gerrig/dp/020533511X).

though, I guess many other general psychology would do the job.
But what is more crucial, and which is by far the most important link in the whole blog post, is

* [Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People (1936)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People)

as it exactly covers the soft approach nerds struggle with.
What I like is the main premise that every person want to feel important (no matter if it is a janitor, or a world-class author) and if you make her/him feel saw in a genuine way, it will do wonders for your contact.
While this book is not about dating, it captures fundamental of this soft human interactions.

For a shorter read, take a look at:

* [17 Psychological Tricks To Make People Like You Immediately](http://www.iflscience.com/brain/17-psychological-tricks-to-make-people-like-you-immediately/all/), with an emphasis on:
  * **smile** - I mean, modify your facial expression; show you emotions (and interest)!
  * **casually touch them*** - this one is crucial, but also should be done gradually, with care; and even before: maintain some eye contact!
  * **tell them a secret** - to make them feel special, trusted... and actually learn something private about you
  * **let them talk about themselves** - for every person the favourite topic is themselves; and there is common issue with nerds in a passionate monologue.



### It is harder for boys than girls

You may get impression that dating is harder boys than girls - for one it's a chore, and for the the second - it's a choice. Well, the data is unfortunately on your side, see the chart *relationship status fraction vs age* from:

* [Data Science of the Facebook World ](http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2013/04/data-science-of-the-facebook-world/) (2013),

which seems to be a direct consequence that women often date older men

* [OK Cupid Data on Sex, Desirability, and Age](https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2015/07/03/ok-cupid-data-on-sex-desirability-and-age/) by Lisa Wade (2015).

The good news is that while it sucks before for men <25yo, the situation is reversed afterwards. So, (a bit of) time is on your side!

Additionally, from my personal experience (sadly, I don't have data for that) - women with age and experience learn what they want and don't want to do. It makes it easier for nerds, as there is more proactivity on their side, and much less uncertainty, games (e.g. if she says she don't want any sex before marriage she likely means that).

You may say that at least when it comes to sex it is easier for girls:

> For men getting sex is a chore, for women getting sex is a choice.

As in most cases getting *any* sex by a girl is trivial, compared to the effort required by a boy.
So, is it cool? Not necessarily.
While for some men it may be the

> Sex is like pizza - even when it is bad, it is still pretty good.

it's rarely the case for woman. Good sex requires safety, care and effort. (If you want to get a single marker - for a male it is usually trivial to experience an orgasm during each intercourse; rarely for a female)

And even if a women is up for *one night stand*, she rarely wants to be treated as an object, as *a piece of meat*. A men using her only as a means for his pleasure will rarely put effort into pleasing her.

Additionally, if there are many eyes looking at a bar, or many Tinder messages, it is harder to find genuinely interested guys (who may be shy) among the crowd of false-positives.
Is she is rather interested in *one life stand*, it gets even trickier.


### Girl's perspective

First, for most your problems there are similar or analogue - what gives you an idea that she has it easier to find someone with similar interests, or to overcome shyness?

Second, there is much more social pressure on the way she behaves. Parts are related to putting value on girls chastity. But it seems that the highest burden is from (often unrealistic) expectations related to the beauty standards. In the worst case she may feel that her whole dating prospects are reduced to her looks, see this drawing:

* [It's not only looks](http://66.media.tumblr.com/7050d427d3d58a7e0c6d86e4436ffb35/tumblr_oad6r4kAcr1sxo1gdo1_1280.jpg) by [Patrizia Comino](http://patriziacomino.tumblr.com/)

Third, she has many legitimate concerns related to her safety:

* getting **pregnant** - all health burden is on her, and most of the social one (even if you take the full responsibility, which she might doubt),
* contracting an **STI** - while it happens to men, for women risks are higher - both of transmission and consequences; they are less reckless, when it comes to the risks,
* attracting a **stalker** or any other way of maintaining contact with her against her will,
* getting **raped** - by you, your drunk friend, some stranger on her way home; sadly roughly 20% of women fall victims (XXX check and link XXX).

When it comes to physical violence:

* [Almost all men are stronger than almost all women - r/dataisbeutiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/4vcxd0/almost_all_men_are_stronger_than_almost_all_women/)

and women know that. Even if you never use force, they know that you could.
Even if you know you would never hurt her, make sure to make her feel safe.
Make sure you respect her wishes (especially *noes*; with *yeses* usually there is less friction) and that she can safely express them; and that you won't try to circumvent it.

* [Tea Consent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQbei5JGiT8)

What really helps is if you know her though a network of friends, and there are people she trusts that can vouch for you.


### Interests

(What I wanted to write here?)

### Everyone is a weirdo

One of the key lessons I've learnt from having flatmates is that everyone is a weirdo.
(Which turns out to be important in business.)

If she behaves strangely, it


### Gender differences

Or: *Let's be friends... with benefits*


The traditional ways to deal with that is to say that men and women cannot be friends.
