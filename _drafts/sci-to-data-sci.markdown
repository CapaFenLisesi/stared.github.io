![Science to Data Science (goofy)]({site.url}}/imgs/2015-12-10-science-data-science-goofy.png)

> TODO: linking some things

(Just a bit of my background: I did undergraduate studies in physics and mathematics at the University of Warsaw, and PhD studies in theoretical quantum optics and information at ICFO - The Institute of Photonic Science. I really like science, but my experience with academic system was mixed.)

When meeting acquaintances, the typical conversation goes as follows:

* acq: _I saw you finished your PhD [in Dec 2014]. So, what do you do right now?_
* me: _It's complicated: various places, various things, but finally I feel free!_
* acq: _You mean, you are unemployed?_
* me: _No, no! I have $ from it. Actually, very good $._
* acq: _Oh, I see... [and an awkward silence]"_
* me: _But it's legal!_

I do data science freelancing. That is, I take short contracts related to data visualization (custom charts in D3.js), machine learning (predicting things, e.g. user growth of a company), preparing and conducting trainings in data analysis, and other data expertise tasks (e.g. merging data from various source). It's rather a consulting-like service than being a code-monkey.

I aim at short projects - I like energy, deadlines (sic!), and novelty. Typically I run 2-3 projects simultaneously.
Some projects are purely commercial, some are academic or for NGOs (but still with grant money), some are my personal side-projects.
In almost all of them I have a lot of freedom in setting how I am going to solve a problem In fact, usually I am required to propose a solution for their problem, e.g. to design a data visualization, not only code it.

Right now, I love it! Here is why:

* I'm free (I can move anywhere, anytime and I don't need to ask anyone for permission; it has some very direct benefits, like being able to live with my girlfriend, instead of a few thousand km away).
* I have sense of being needed (people are contacting me are they really want to solve a task they couldn't do by themselves).
* I'm being appreciated (maybe it's shallow, but instead of being "yet another PhD student" I am Piotr Migdał).
* Data science is a rapidly growing field, with yesterday's challenges are today's industry standards (rather than yesterday's hopes being today's... hopes).
* I have a lot of intellectual stimulation (the last time I had such is 8 years ago or so - when starting my stuies); partly because each project is different, partly because I cannot cherry-pick a small part of it, but I need to solve it end-to-end, partly because I am not confined to a subsubdiscipline.
* No bureaucracy, it takes almost an instant from agreeing to starting a project.
* I feel that the programing word is much more meritocratic than academia (interviews are hard and technical, instead of looking at with whom I worked (i.e. recommendations); I am being contracted because my particular skills are needed, regardless of other formal critiera; having a PhD is an impressive discussion-starter, but it's almost never required - and I consider it a good sign!)
* No politics - as a freelancer I can avoid it almost completely.
* Projects are fast - if sometimes does not work, instead of getting more and more frustrated over the course of years, there are quick pivots or decisions.
* Much more $; while I was never too greedy, it has a direct consequence:
  * I can buy a lot of time for my own projects (read: Quantum Game, teaching students).
  * I am the chooser - all projects I accepted in the last year where ones I really enjoyed!
* I interact with various people (IT, marketing, management and scientists) rather than only with fellow scientists.
* I still travel a lot (mostly to do my trainings).

The overall difference is tremendous - from swings between depression and frustration (with occasional rays of hope) and a very unproductive state by default, to feeling great and learning a lot. Of course, it is also a function on my personal traits (chaotic, hot-headed, multidisciplinary, loving data, disliking hierarchy, a bit narcissistic[^1]) and my particular experience of academia.

I thought that the escape from academia would burn bridges, especially as I was openly saying I wanted to move out after my PhD defense[^2]. Yet, from time to time I am being invited for scientific talks or collaboration, even when I make it explicit that I am no longer in academia (or aim to be again).

Very often I am being asked by academics how to make the transition from physics or mathematics to data science or programming, and I do my best to give as detailed, personal and practical answers as possible. When I get such emails, it's flattering when it comes from undergraduate students, I feel sympathetic when it's from PhD students, and it is sad - when from people, who have invested in academia a number of years after their PhDs. Especially ones that love academia with its quirks, but have family to support and cannot bear the lack of security and constant move.

I have never regretted my transition. As I see the struggle of postdocs, and ties & administrative duties of established professors, I am getting more and more convinced that for me it's easier to contribute to science and education while being an independent freelancer, that from within the system[^3]. And I love freelancing as the model of work-life (im)balance:

> Freelancing is something exactly between having holidays and deadlines all the time.

## Caveat

Don't try to treat it as an unconditional recommendation of data science freelancing!

Data science is great, but you need to enjoy programming, dealing with real & dirty data and with "good enough" solutions. (But no, you don't need to work in adverts or finance.)

Freelancing is a perpendicular dimension. And some people love it, some hate and it boils down to your psychological traits and whether you are able to get clients. The "normal way" to do data science is via full-time works.

## Empowering the readers

There are a few follow-ups I'm considering:

* How did I learn about data science?
* How to transition from academia to data science? (mostly practical links)
* Why I got disappointed by academia?

If you like to hear about one of these topics, mail me! :)

I would like to thank Michał Kotowski for comments on the draft. This blog post started as an email o Artem Kaznatcheev entitled "what I do" I wrote when flying from Dublin to NYC.

[^1]: Sometimes I say that *freelancing is a way to monetize one's narcissism*.
[^2]: To be absolutely fair, I did apply to a single postdoc. But even then I collected notes in a file entitled [Stockholm syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome).
[^3]: I already did a one-week intensive introduction to data analysis in Python for social scientists.
