> TODO: picture "before" and "after"

When meeting acquaintances, the typical talk goes as follows:

* acq: _I saw you finished your PhD [in Dec 2014]. So, what do you do right now?_
* me: _It's complicated: various places, various things, but finally I feel free!_
* acq: _You mean, you are unemployed?_
* me: _No, no! I have $ from it. Actually, very good $._
* acq: _Oh, I see... [and an awkward silence]"_
* me: _But it's legal!_

I do data science freelancing. That is, I take short contracts related to data visualization (custom charts in D3.js), machine learning (predicting things, e.g. user growth of a company), preparing and conducting trainings in data analysis, and sometimes other data expertise tasks (e.g. telling what can be done with a dataset). It's rather a consulting-like service than being a code-monkey (i.e. I am required to lead it and the hourly rate is more than decent; in particular I don't use freelancing websites, which usually offer mundane or repetitive projects at a lower rate).

I aim at short projects - I like energy, deadlines (sic!), and novelty. Typically I run 2-3 projects simultaneously.
Some projects are purely commercial, some are academic or for NGOs (but still with grant money), some are strictly for voluntary work (but then they are based on my ideas; I clearly have more ideas than time).
In almost all of them I have a lot of freedom in setting how I am going to solve a problem (usually I am required to propose a solution for their problem, e.g. to design a data visualization, not only code it).

Right now, I love it! It's why:

* I'm free (I can move anywhere, I don't need to ask anyone for permission; it has some very direct benefits, like being able to live with my girlfriend, instead of a few thousand km away).
* I do have some impact (people are using it, learning etc; I had no such sense doing quantum information).
* I'm being appreciated (maybe it's shallow, but I prefer to be someone mailed directly for a task, than yet another PhD student begging for opportunities).
* It's a rapidly growing field, with yesterday challenges being ~~tomorrow~~ today industry standards (rather than yesterday hopes being today disappointments).
* I have a lot of intellectual stimulation (the last time I had such is 8 years ago or so); partly because each project is different, partly because I cannot cherry-pick a small part of it, but I need to solve it end-to-end, partly because I am not confined in a subsubdiscipline.
* No bureaucracy, it takes almost an instant from agreeing to starting a project.
* Much more meritocratic (often interviews are hard and technical, instead of looking at with whom I worked (i.e. recommendations); I've never heard being rejected for my gender, nationality or another official status; in many places having a PhD is an impressive discussion-starter, but it's almost never required - and I consider it a good sign!)
* Projects are fast - if sometimes does not work, instead of getting more and more frustrated over the course of years, there are quick pivots or decisions.
* Much more $; while I was never too greedy, it has a direct consequence:
  * I can buy a lot of time for my own projects (read: Quantum Game, teaching students).
  * I am the chooser - all projects I accepted in the last year where ones I really enjoyed!
* I interact with various people (IT, marketing, management).
* I still travel a lot (less conferences, but more of trainings).

It is more complicated and nuanced, but the overall difference is tremendous - from swings between depression and frustration (with occasional rays of hope) and a very unproductive state by default, to feeling great and learning a lot. Of course, it is also a function on my personal traits (smart and creative but chaotic and hot-headed, multidisciplinary, a data-lover, disliking hierarchy, a bit narcissistic[^1]) and my particular experience of academia.

It though that the escape from academia would burn bridges, especially as I was openly saying I want to move out after my PhD defense[^2]. Yet, from time to time I am being invited somewhere, even when I make it explicit that I am no longer in academia (or aim to be again).

Very often I am being asked by academicians how to make the transition from physics or mathematics to data science or programming, and I do my best to give as detailed, personal and practical answers as possible. When I get such emails, it's flattering when it comes from undergraduate students, I feel sympathetic when it's from PhD students, and it is sad - when from people, who have invested in academia a number of years after their PhDs. Especially ones that love academia with their quirks, but have family on their support and cannot bare the lack of security and constant move.

I have never regretted this decision. As I see the struggle of postdocs, and ties & administrative duties of established professors, I am getting more and more convinced that for me it's easier to contribute to science and education while being an independent freelancer, that from within the system[^3]. And I love freelancing as the model of work-life (im)balance:

> Freelancing is something exactly between having holidays and deadlines all the time.

## Caveat

Don't try to treat it as an unconditional recommendation of data science freelancing.

Data science is great, but you need to enjoy programming, dealing with real & dirty data and with "good enough" solutions. (But no, you don't need to work in adverts or finance.)

Freelancing is yet another story - some people love it, some hate (or would love but can't manage) and mostly bases on psychological traits and whether you are able to get clients. The "normal way" to do data science is via full-time works.

## Empowering the readers

There are a few follow-ups I consider.

* How did I learn about data science?
* How to transition from academia to data science? (mostly links)
* Why I got disappointed by academia?

[^1]: Sometimes I say that freelancing is a way to monetize one's narcissism.
[^2]: To be absolutely fair, I did apply to a single postdoc. But even then I collected notes in a file entitled [Stockholm syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome).
[^3]: I already did a one-week intensive introduction to data analysis in Python for social scientists.
